The area is situated near the river Thames and has multiple skyscrapers that form an intrinsic part of the London skyline, offering unique views over the city.

Newly opened Nando's also in the just off the High Street.There are a selection of eating a drinking establishments found along Sydenham Road and locally from great Indian takeaways (we recommend trying Barakah Indian takeaway) to great pubs such as The Dolphin (gastro pub) and The Greyhound to name but a few.You will also find a “The Gym” on Sydenham Road as well as Shapers (women only gym), all the other sporting and recreational activities accessible via the local leisure centre.However, if you require the convenience of other known high street names, you will find, Costa, Sainsbury’s, Aldi, Sports Direct, B&Q, Next to name but a few along the high street and in local Bell Green retail park.SCHOOLS ARE A BIG ATTRACTION IN THE LOCAL AREA:The property is in proximity of several local schools which are highly rated by OFSTED. In our experience, it’s unusual to find a property that is located to this many highly-rated schools. These schools include St Dunstan's College - Church of England, mixed, primary and secondary. This is a private school and an independent Montessori just a few minutes away.Min Tenancy Lenght : 12 months Council Tax Band : E Council Tax Band:  Holding Deposit: £576.00",

The property further benefits from a very large boarded loft. To the rear there is a delightful mature garden with a westerly aspect and private outlook. With Sydenham High Street only moments away and Sydenham station with excellent links to London Bridge and also the East London line.Location:General information:Less than 200 years ago Sydenham was a sleepy hamlet in the Kent countryside. All changed in 1852 when the Directors of the Railway company had the bright idea of buying and moving the Crystal Palace built by St Joseph Paxton for the Great Exhibition in 1851 from Hyde Park to Sydenham. Their idea was to encourage Londoners to take a day out 'in the country' to visit the new enlarged Crystal Palace set in its own pleasure gardens complete with pools, fountains and even a Dinosaur Theme Park. A sort of combination of Disneyland and Jurassic Park!This transformed Sydenham into a fashionable Victorian town for Londoners to visit which inevitably grew and merged to now make Sydenham an integral multi-ethnic part of South East London. The FA Cup was played here, Colour TV was invented here, the first pneumatic railway ran through Sydenham and many famous & notorious people have made it their homeIn 1871 Sydenham was imortalised in the works of the exiled Camille Pissaro - the most famous of which, a view along Lawrie Park Avenue towards St Bart's Church, now hangs in the National Gallery. Other famous residents of Sydenham have included Ernest Shackleton, the Antartic explorer, Sir George Groves, compiler of the musical dictionary, and W G Grace, England's greatest cricketer.Sydenham station has recently opened the East London tube line extension that connects Sydenham to Surrey Quays and Islington Council Tax Band:  Holding Deposit: £0.00",
