Complete with a gable roof flanked by stucco ornamentation, this characterful frontage conceals a design-led home. A truly open-plan kitchen and reception room takes the ground floor. Dark veins dance across the white marble of the stylish kitchen. This space features a Rangemaster cooker and an American-style fridge freezer. Undulating wooden cabinetry provides contrast against the marble worktops and a connection to the living area – where bespoke joinery and soft lighting create a sense of warmth. Stone floors flow into an adjoining dining room, illuminated by a large skylight. A wooden-clad ceiling speaks of Scandi influences and a connection to nature.Upstairs, the principal bedroom suite has a vaulted ceiling with white-painted beams and a separate dressing room. A bank of timber wardrobes hides the entrance to a pink-toned en suite bathroom with a high ceiling, porthole window and dual marble vanity.A calming guest bedroom features fitted storage and a tropical feature wall. The Middle East-inspired family bathroom features a frameless walk-in rainfall shower and distinctive teal plasterwork.Location: This characterful home is close to Notting Hill’s best restaurants, market stalls and shopping streets.

        "description": "This two bedroom flat represents the apogee of all that one dreams of when seeking an exceptional London residence. The open plan kitchen living room is a masterpiece. The kitchen area is demarcated with stunning marble flooring and a glorious extended marble breakfast bar. It is fully integrated and has plenty of storage to ensure everything is housed comfortably.The living room is incredibly spacious and has wooden flooring throughout. Plenty of light is allowed to flood in via the floor to celing windows and it links directly to a large terrace which runs across its entire length. The views are breathtaking as one feels a one is placed on The Thames itself. The water, The City and Tower Bridge are just a few of the sites within full view.The master bedroom is annexed within the flat and would be sizeable enough to please most if it were the entire flat. From the bedroom one can enjoy the same view as from the living room and there is a private hallway leading to it which offers a tremendous amount of clothes storage. The glory of this section however is located in the private bathroom. The aesthetic is stunning and there is a walk in shower and a crafted wooden bath which has such appeal that it would be well placed in an art gallery.The second bedroom would surely be the main room in any other apartment and again there are the same views along with plenty of wardrobe space. The main bathroom is in keeping with the rest of the apartment.The development houses top of the range features including a 20m swimming pool with white gold tiles, a separate male and female sauna & steam room, a Vitality pool, a state of the art gymnasium and fitness room, a luxurious treatment room, virtual golf, a business lounge and 24 hour concierge.For those who enjoy dining out you are close to the Tom Sellers Story restaurant, The OXO Tower, Gaucho and Borough Market, and for those who prefer shopping The Royal Exchange is nearby featuring, Bulgari, Gucci, Hermes, Dolce & Gabbana, Louis Vuitton and Tiffany & Co.London Bridge Station with the Jubilee and Northern line and it's mainline connection are just a short walk away.

        "description": "*Available furnished or unfurnished!*Looking for a brand-new apartment with dual-aspect light – set in one of the tallest residential developments in London?This luxury balcony 2-bed (778 sq ft) on the 23rd floor of the new Icon Building comes with underfloor heating and floor-to-ceiling windows, a private balcony facing south, and a northwest and southwest-facing dual aspect for the best of the natural light throughout the day and the evening.As you step through onto the engineered wood flooring of your new entrance hallway, you’ll find the first of two bedrooms straight ahead, with a northwest-facing aspect to capture the bright morning sun.Next to the bedroom, you’ll find an additional enclosed storage area, with the first of two bathrooms opposite – complete with a heated towel rail, ceramic floor tiling, and prestigious finishings by Laufen and Hans Grohe.As you explore further down the hallway, you’ll come to the apartment’s master bedroom, with a southwest-facing aspect for the best of the warm evening light.You’ll also find a private en-suite bathroom attached to the master bedroom, with similar high specifications to the main bathroom.Across from the master bedroom, this high-spec apartment opens out into a bright and airy open-plan living, dining, and kitchen area. And the first thing you’ll notice is the abundance of natural light pouring in through the floor-to-ceiling windows of its northwest and southwest-facing dual aspect.To your right, you’ll find a fully equipped and custom-designed kitchen area, complete with feature-lit cabinetry over a granite worktop, as well as a full range of integrated appliances by Bosch or similar (including an extractor over a touch-control ceramic hob and oven, a combination microwave, a fridge-freezer, and a dishwasher).As you cross the wooden flooring of your new living room, you’ll open the doors to the fresh air of your own private, south-facing balcony. It’s an ideal outdoor spot, with 23rd-floor views perfectly positioned to capture the full natural light throughout the day – and it’s a welcome extra space for when you’re entertaining guests.Beyond the walls of your immaculate new home, you’ll be a part of the Icon Building residents’ community, along with all the facilities and amenities that entails. As a resident of Icon Building, you’ll have access to:•\tA 5-Star Gym with Yoga, Meditation, and a Holistic Suite•\tPrivate Dining with Hire Facilities•\tA Private Bar with a Courtyard Lounge•\tA Residents’ Screening Room•\tA Cocktail Bar, Coffee & Breakfast Bar•\tA Private Roof Garden•\tA Co-working Office Space•\tAnd a 24-hour Concierge Service.You’ll be just a 2-minute walk from the Central Line at North Acton Station, giving you direct links into the city through Oxford Street, Bank, and Liverpool Street – as well as a 9-minute walk from the rail services at Acton Main Line for direct links to Paddington or Heathrow.It’s just a 10-minute walk to the green open spaces of the nearby North Acton Playing Fields – and only 15 minutes to the Paddington Branch of the Regent’s Canal, for waterside walks within reach of your door.This brand-new and high-spec 2-bed in one of London’s highest residential developments comes with immaculate interiors, a northwest and southwest-facing dual aspect, and a south-facing private balcony for maximum natural light.And that means a desirable property like this won’t be around for long.So if you’re looking for a luxury apartment in a high-spec new development – with transport, green spaces, and a huge range of on-site facilities – give us a call and we’ll show you everything life at Icon Building has to offer.",
