With Sydenham High Street only moments away and Sydenham station with excellent links to London Bridge and also the East London line.Location:General information:Less than 200 years ago Sydenham was a sleepy hamlet in the Kent countryside. All changed in 1852 when the Directors of the Railway company had the bright idea of buying and moving the Crystal Palace built by St Joseph Paxton for the Great Exhibition in 1851 from Hyde Park to Sydenham. Their idea was to encourage Londoners to take a day out 'in the country' to visit the new enlarged Crystal Palace set in its own pleasure gardens complete with pools, fountains and even a Dinosaur Theme Park. A sort of combination of Disneyland and Jurassic Park!This transformed Sydenham into a fashionable Victorian town for Londoners to visit which inevitably grew and merged to now make Sydenham an integral multi-ethnic part of South East London. The FA Cup was played here, Colour TV was invented here, the first pneumatic railway ran through Sydenham and many famous & notorious people have made it their homeIn 1871 Sydenham was imortalised in the works of the exiled Camille Pissaro - the most famous of which, a view along Lawrie Park Avenue towards St Bart's Church, now hangs in the National Gallery. Other famous residents of Sydenham have included Ernest Shackleton, the Antartic explorer, Sir George Groves, compiler of the musical dictionary, and W G Grace, England's greatest cricketer.Sydenham station has recently opened the East London tube line extension that connects Sydenham to Surrey Quays and Islington Council Tax Band:  Holding Deposit: \u00a30.00","features":["0.3 MILES TO SYDENHAM OVERGROUND STATION","WOODEN FLOORING THROUGHOUT","SEMI-DETACHED HOME","NEWLY REFURBISHED","TWO RECEPTION ROOMS","UNFURNISHED"],"rent_details":{"let_type":"Long term","deposit":null,"furnish_type":"Unfurnished"},"images":["https:\/\/media.rightmove.co.uk\/43k\/42117\/109353857\/42117_000324979_IMG_07_0000.jpeg","https:\/\/media.rightmove.co.uk\/43k\/42117\/109353857\/42117_000324979_IMG_00_0000.jpeg","https:\/\/media.rightmove.co.uk\/43k\/42117\/109353857\/42117_000324979_IMG_08_0000.jpeg","https:\/\/media.rightmove.co.uk\/43k\/42117\/109353857\/42117_000324979_IMG_03_0000.jpeg","https:\/\/media.rightmove.co.uk\/43k\/42117\/109353857\/42117_000324979_IMG_11_0000.jpeg","https:\/\/media.rightmove.co.uk\/43k\/42117\/109353857\/42117_000324979_IMG_12_0000.jpeg","https:\/\/media.rightmove.co.uk\/43k\/42117\/109353857\/42117_000324979_IMG_05_0000.jpeg","https:\/\/media.rightmove.co.uk\/43k\/42117\/109353857\/42117_000324979_IMG_14_0000.jpeg","https:\/\/media.rightmove.co.uk\/43k\/42117\/109353857\/42117_000324979_IMG_04_0000.jpeg","https:\/\/media.rightmove.co.uk\/43k\/42117\/109353857\/42117_000324979_IMG_13_0000.jpeg","https:\/\/media.rightmove.co.uk\/43k\/42117\/109353857\/42117_000324979_IMG_09_0000.jpeg","https:\/\/media.rightmove.co.uk\/43k\/42117\/109353857\/42117_000324979_IMG_10_0000.jpeg","https:\/\/media.rightmove.co.uk\/43k\/42117\/109353857\/42117_000324979_IMG_02_0000.jpeg","https:\/\/media.rightmove.co.uk\/43k\/42117\/109353857\/42117_000324979_IMG_01_0000.jpeg","https:\/\/media.rightmove.co.uk\/43k\/42117\/109353857\/42117_000324979_IMG_06_0000.jpeg"],"link":"https:\/\/www.rightmove.co.uk\/properties\/109353857#\/?channel=RES_LET","agent_email":null,"floorplan":"https:\/\/media.rightmove.co.uk\/dir\/43k\/42117\/109353857\/42117_000324979_FLP_00_0000.jpeg"},{"address":"Rushmore Road, Hackney, E5","price":2100,"property_type":"Apartment","bedrooms":2,"bathrooms":1.0,"sizesqft":null,"latitude":51.554543,"longitude":-0.044068,"date_added":"Added today","description":"This trully stunning 2 bedroom first floor apartment offers a pure taste of class, when it comes to syle and design!The entire apartment has been renovated to a high standard, giving you the ultimate feeling of pride and excitement!The apartment has been installed with premium spotlights, creating a real sense of atmosphere.The sash windows throughout the apartment gives you a mixture of a contemporary and modern feel.The kitchen is of a state of the art, modern design with integrated appliances, units all around the room.
